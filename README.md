# Operation-on-Rational-Number 
This C++ program, titled "Rational Number.cpp," implements rational numbers and various operations on them. The program provides functionality for setting rational numbers, performing arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, and comparing rational numbers using relational and equality operators. Additionally, the program allows for input and output streaming of rational numbers.

The rational class defines rational numbers with numerator (n) and denominator (d) attributes. It includes methods for setting rational numbers, overloading input and output stream operators (>> and <<), and overloading arithmetic and comparison operators (+, -, *, /, >, <, ==).

The main function (main()) presents a menu-driven interface allowing users to choose operations to perform on rational numbers. Users can set two rational numbers, perform arithmetic operations, compare them using relational operators, and stream them for input and output. The program runs until the user chooses to exit.

Overall, this program provides a comprehensive implementation of rational numbers with a user-friendly interface for interaction and operation.
